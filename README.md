# About the project
## FunDApp
FunDApp is a crowdfunding application built on solana. When a fundraiser is created, the solana program stores details such as title, description, target amount, collected amount and authority in a PDA.
Contributors can contribute any amount to the fundraiser and the funds will be sent to the PDA. The authority of the fundraiser has the access to close the fundraiser whenever they want
